# Human-computer interaction 2020

This repository contains the **products of our final project** for the HCI 2020 course of the Software Engineering major at [UADY, FMAT](https://www.matematicas.uady.mx/). The project was developed according to user-center design methodology.

## User-Centered Design

User-centered design is an iterative approach to problem solving that focuses on users on every step of a product's design and development. According to [Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design), the UCD steps are understanding context of use, specifying requirements, designing a solution and evaluating the solution against requirements.

We logically divided the project into three deliveries or phases, which cover the previous UCD steps:

1. **Users**. In this phase we specified the target users, learning about them and understanding the context of use of the product. It was very important to have a clear understanding of the problem at this stage.
2. **Prototypes**. This was a multi-part phase, which covered specification of requirements, design and implementation of medium-fidelity prototypes.
3. **Evaluation**. We conducted remote and moderated user testing with three participants. This phase allowed us to spot some design decisions in the prototypes that we were previously unaware of.

## Team organization

The team members are
[HernÃ¡n Cervera](https://github.com/HerCerM),
[Elena Medina](https://github.com/Flowah155),
[Alvar Peniche](https://github.com/JefApr) and
[Magdiel Pech](https://github.com/MagdielPm).

The project was divided into the three phases mentioned in [User-centered design](#user-centered-design). The project began on April 4th and ended on June 15, with each phase taking around three weeks to complete.

We had two sources for planning:

## Reflective diaries

In addition to the project, we were required to write a reflective diary covering any HCI topics of our interest. The entries for each team member are found in [ReflectiveDiaries](ReflectiveDiaries).
